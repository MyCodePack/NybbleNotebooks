## Binder
Binder enables you to easily run these notebooks straight from your browser! It will spin up a virutal Jupyter environment that provides native interaction. Just know that setup may take a bit as it needs to spins up your virtual container. If you run into issues, try using a different browser. Firefox seemed the most stable for me.

Use the button below to view all the notebooks in a Binder or use one of the individual links in the [Individual Notebooks](#individual-notebooks) section.
